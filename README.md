#### scripting with python

## Introduction
welcome to the most interesting repo where I house all custom scripts I used across different tasks over the years. Each script have descriptive name and comments. 

Refer to the list below to understand the scripts and the motivation behind.

## Usage
Since these scripts are not meant to be learn in isolated environments, the packages are not organized in virtual servers instead I have a universal `requirements.txt` for important packages. But the majority ships with python
